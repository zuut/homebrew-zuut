# Overview

MOC, the markedup object compiler is a code generator that generates any type of text file based on a set of annotated class definitions.

# Prerequisites

Building MOC requires bison and flex, but these aren't needed during runtime.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install zuut/zuut/zuut-moc`

Or `brew tap zuut/zuut` and then `brew install zuut-moc`.
